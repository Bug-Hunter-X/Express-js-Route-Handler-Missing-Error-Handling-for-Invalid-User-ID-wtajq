# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input parameters. Specifically, the provided code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer without first validating that it is actually a number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the user ID is not a valid integer.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that incorporates robust error handling.
